Hi Team,

Found some time from work and other commitments to complete this.

Sample request to test the endpoints:

http://localhost:8080/billing/bill/1/4000

1. Have hardcoded 2 customers. Customer with id '1' is Premium customer and with id '2' or any other Integer is Regular. 

Corresponding test end point for Regular customer is : http://localhost:8080/billing/bill/2/5000.
